    <p class="contentdiscription">Amidst the wrinkles and a Gandalf beard, a young Fauja Singh runs with a twinkle in his eyes and smile on his face. The world's oldest marathoner holds records for the 200 m, 400 m, 800 m, mile and 3000 m for his age group; all these records set within a single 94 minute period.</p>

    <p class="contentdiscription">He was one the torch bearer of 2012 Olympics in Great Britain.</p>
    </p>

    <p class="contentdiscription">He attributes his physical fitness and longevity to abstaining from smoking and alcohol and to following a simple vegetarian diet. He is also the oldest man to be featured in a PETA campaign.</p>

    <p class="contentdiscription">Fauja Singh is a living legend and an enormous inspiration to all generations after him.</p>
